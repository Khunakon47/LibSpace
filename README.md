# LibSpace – KKU Library Room Booking Prototype

LibSpace is a front-end room booking prototype designed to simulate how students can reserve study rooms in a university library.  
The project focuses on JavaScript-driven interactions, responsive UI design, and simulating a realistic multi-step booking experience — all without backend integration.

This project demonstrates form validation, time-slot selection, and calendar interaction using front-end logic only.

## 📚 Key Features
- **Interactive calendar** that updates dates dynamically using JavaScript  
- **Multi-step booking process** (Room selection → Date → Time → Confirmation)  
- **Dynamic form validation**  
- **Simulated room availability**  
- **Clean, student-friendly UI**  
- Responsive layout suitable for desktop and mobile  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**

## 🎯 Project Purpose
LibSpace was created as a personal project to explore building a fully interactive front-end system without relying on a backend.  
The project demonstrates:
- Logical flow design  
- JavaScript DOM manipulation  
- User interaction handling  
- UI/UX design for booking systems  

This prototype showcases how a real room booking system *could* work, using only front-end code.

## 📂 Status
This is a **front-end prototype**.  
Planned or possible future improvements:
- Backend for real-time room availability  
- User login system  
- Database for storing bookings  
- Admin dashboard for managing room schedules  
- Improved UX for mobile users
